								Kohli started 2016 with scores of 91 and 59 in the first two ODIs of the limited-overs tour of Australia.
								He followed it up with a pair of hundreds–a run-a-ball 117 at Melbourne and 106 from 92 balls at Canberra–in
								the next two matches. During the course of the series, he became the fastest batsman in the world to cross
								the 7000-run mark in ODIs, getting to the milestone in his 161st innings, and the fastest to get to 25
								centuries. After the ODI series ended in a 1–4 loss, the Indian team came back to whitewash the Australians
								3–0 in the T20I series. Kohli made fifties in all three T20Is with scores of 90 not out, 59 not out
								and 50, winning two man of the matches as well as the man of the series award. He was also instrumental
								in India winning the Asia Cup in Bangladesh the following month in which he scored 49 in a run-chase of 84
								against Pakistan, followed by an unbeaten 56 against Sri Lanka and 41 not out in the Final against 
								Bangladesh in two more successful chases

								Kohli started dating Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma in 2013; the couple soon earned the celebrity 
								couple nickname "Virushka". Their relationship attracted substantial media attention, with
								persistent rumours and speculations in the media, as neither of the two publicly talked about it.
								The couple married on 11 December 2017 in a private ceremony in Florence, Italy.
								Kohli has admitted that he is superstitious. He used to wear black wristbands as a cricket superstition;
								earlier, he used to wear the same pair of gloves with which he had "been scoring". Apart from a religious
								black thread, he has also been wearing a kara on his right arm since 2012.

							<h3 class="text-center">Commercial investments</h3>

								According to Kohli, football is his second favourite sport. In 2014, Kohli became a co-owner of Indian
								Super League club FC Goa. He stated that he invested in the club with the "keenness of football" and because
								he "wanted football to grow in India". He added, "It's a business venture for me for the future. Cricket
								's not going to last forever and I'm keeping all my options open after retirement."
								In September 2015, Kohli became a co-owner of the International Premier Tennis League franchise UAE Royals,
								and, in December that year, became a co-owner of the JSW-owned Bengaluru Yodhas franchise in Pro Wrestling
								League.
								In November 2014, Kohli and Anjana Reddy's Universal Sportsbiz (USPL) launched a youth fashion brand WROGN.
								The brand started to produce men's casual wear clothing in 2015 and has tied up with Myntra and Shopper's
								Stop.In late 2014, Kohli was announced as a shareholder and brand ambassador of the social networking
								venture 'Sport Convo' based in London.

							<h3 class="text-center">Charity</h3>
							<p class="text-justify mt-2">
								In March 2013, Kohli started a charity foundation called Virat Kohli Foundation (VKF).
								The organisation aims at helping underprivileged kids and conducts events to raise funds for the charity.
								 According to Kohli, the foundation works with select NGOs to "create awareness, seek support and raise
								funds for the various causes they endorse and the philanthropic work they engage in." In May 2014, 
								eBay and Save the Children India conducted a charity auction with VKF, with its proceeds benefiting the 
								education and healthcare of underprivileged children.
